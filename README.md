```

### 🏞 Supported environments

## 🛠 Using Bootstrap

After the adder runs,

- You can use Bootstrap classes like `card` or `pt-5` in the markup (components, routes, `app.html`).

- You can [customize your Bootstrap theme with variables](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/customize/sass/) like `$primary` or `$grid-breakpoints` in `src/variables.scss`.
